# Omnitags

This monorepo goals is to experiment on the implementation of Omnitags. Omnitags is a joki website created using codeigniter 3 and bootstrap 4, aiming to streamline the variables of table and field names using global variables that I store in a JSON file. This json file can compatible for exporting to both coding and testing using postman. Projects that are approved will be put into individual repository for further development. The branches is named after it's database name.

## How Omnitags Works

Omnitags relies on a branch-based approach to project management, allowing for different modules and applications to exist within the same repository. This means that instead of starting from scratch or copying existing codebases, users can simply switch between branches to implement or modify the framework for various projects. This approach saves development time and ensures consistency across applications.
